# ffmpeg_muxer
a small project aiming to mux a video file and an audio file to one video file (just needed by my self), the first trying of ffmpeg api



<p style="color:red">!!! THIS PROJECT IS JUST A TRIAL OF FFMPEG API, NOT FOLLOWED ANY CODE CONVENTIONS !!!</p>



### Simple build

Install ffmpeg and modify the path of ffmpeg in CMakeLists.txt.

```shell
make build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

then u will get the executable file under current dir if there's no error occurs.
